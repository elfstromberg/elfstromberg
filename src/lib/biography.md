I'm a Swedish textile artist born 1995 in Stockholm. I hold a BA in Human Ecology from Lund University (2019) and ecological sustainability has continued to be an important aspect of my textile work.

Through my use of waste material I investigate how this trash can be re-vitalized and gain value once again. Through natural dyeing and weaving I use this material to talk about climate change and the value of our resources.

I have teaching experience in weaving and natural dying, both for practitioner schools and workshops. I have also done custom rugs and wall hangings.
