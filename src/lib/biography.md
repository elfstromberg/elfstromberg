I'm a Swedish textile artist born 1995 in Stockholm. Through my use of waste material I investigate how this trash can be re-vitalized and gain value once again. Through natural dyeing and weaving I use this material to talk about climate change and the value of our resources.

I hold a BA in Human Ecology from Lund University (2019) and ecological sustainability has continued to be an important aspect of my textile work. 

I received my MFA in Craft in 2024 from Konstfack University of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm where I developed my artistic project Zombie Textiles: Weaving with undead waste which I also describe in my [final thesis](https://konstfack.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1866527&dswid=1873). In 2020 - 2022 I studied textile craft at Capellagården vocational school with a specialization in hand weaving.

I have teaching experience in weaving and natural dying, both for practitioner schools and workshops. I have also done custom rugs and wall hangings.
